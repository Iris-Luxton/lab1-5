                    INFP Personality Type (The Healer)
                    INFPs are imaginative idealists, guided by their own core values and beliefs. 
                    For a Healer type, exploring possibilities takes priority over assessing whether something is “realistic” or not. 
                    They see potential for a better future, and pursue truth and meaning in their own special way.
                    INFPs are sensitive, caring, and compassionate, and are deeply concerned with the personal growth of themselves and others. 
                    Individualistic and nonjudgmental, INFPs believe that each person must find their own path. 
                    They enjoy spending time exploring their own ideas and values, and are gently encouraging to others to do the same.
                    INFPs are creative and often artistic—they enjoy finding new outlets for self-expression.
